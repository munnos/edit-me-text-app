## Description

- This is a simple browser based text editor application that can be downloaded as a progressive web application and used offline locally. This necessitated the incorporation of a number of data persistence options to ensure that data is not lost. 

- The application can be downloaded to a desktop as an application to be used offline. This has been possible through use of the workbox webpack plugin and the use of a manifest.json file.
